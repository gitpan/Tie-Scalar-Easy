Once you have downloaded EasyScalar-0.XX.tar.gz and have extracted it
into a convienient directory, make sure you have entered the EasyScalar
directory created before proceeding.

Run the command 'perl Makefile.PL ; make test' from your shell prompt.
If all goes well, all tests should succeed and you can continue on to
'make install'.

If any tests fail, there is probably a bug in this module. I would
appreciate a bug-report sent to me at jql@accessone.com.

After the module is installed, you should be able to enter the t/
directory and run any of the tests by just running 'perl <test>.t'.

Those are the same tests run when you entered 'make test', but this will
test if the module was installed correctly.
